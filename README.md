# clidms

I needed a small tool which would help me keep my steady growing "Documents"
folder under control. All the currently available DMS seem way to bloated for
my needs, so I started coding my own (This is how programer solve problems,
isn't it?)

**This is currently just a quick draft, coded in a few hours. The code needs a
lot of love and refactoring!**

## My needs / Requirements
I just want to be able to assign tags to my documents and then filter by
combinations of tags and pieces of the name.


## Coming features
- More infos in the DB for every document like timestamp and filetype
- Delete documents (From DB and drom filesystem)
- Edit DB entrys (Change Name, change timestamp)
- Extend the find method to support multiple --tag and --name flags
- ...
